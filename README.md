## Hi! My Name is John Rusty B. Lola ðŸ‘‹
  - I am passionate to becoming a Web Developer by developing a web application as my stepping stone to achieve my goal. During my college years, I made different web applications to fulfill my thesis project and for students/client's desired web application system.

In my career, I'm become a junior programmer then promoted as programmer in a private company that used PHP Programming Language as their back-end and (Bootstrap,JavaScript,jquery,Css) as their front-end. It also used PHP framework such as Laravel and Codeigniter.

And during my freetime and unemployed days, I enrolled myself in various bootcamp such as AWS re/Start program, Bayan Acadamy Frond-End 101, Bayan Academy Back-end 101, Web Development NCII by Tesda.
